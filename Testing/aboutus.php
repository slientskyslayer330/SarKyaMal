      Welcome to Sar Kya Mal, your number one source for Yangon Technology University campus canteen. We're dedicated to give you the very best of informations with a focus on restaurants, food we can get, and estimated time to order.
      </p>
      <p>
      Founded in 2020 by enthusiasts in app developing, Sar Kya Mal has come form the idea that the canteen needed a active website. When one victim student, who had to waited for his food for half an hour each day, first started out, his passion for making a canteen website drove them to collect the canteen data, sketch the idea for website so that Sar Kya Mal can offer you the best informative website in YTU. We now give customers all the data of the canteen, and are thrilled that we're able to turn our passion into our own website.
      </p>
      <p>
      We hope you enjoy our website as much as we enjoy offering them to you.f you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.
      </p>

      Sincerely, <br>
      Victim who waited half an hour for a meal
